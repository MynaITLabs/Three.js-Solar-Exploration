Planet Symbols: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols

Mercury
Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System.
It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.
Mercury is gravitationally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance,[15] and rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System.
The astronomical symbol for Mercury is a stylized version of Hermes' caduceus, â˜¿.

Venus
Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.
It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
It is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, reaching an apparent magnitude of âˆ’4.6 â€“ bright enough to cast shadows at night and, rarely, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.
Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
The astronomical symbol for Venus is the same as that used in biology for the female sex: a circle with a small cross beneath, â™€.

Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring.
Its symbol, a circle with an arrow pointing out to the upper right, is used as a symbol for the male gender, â™‚.

Jupiter
Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules.
A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope.
The astronomical symbol for the planet, â™ƒ, is a stylized representation of the god's lightning bolt.

Saturn
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System.
Saturn is a gas giant because it is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium.
The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust.
Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the god's sickle.

Neptune
Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System.
In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.
It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.

Pluto
Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune.
Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System, and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun.
Light from the Sun takes about 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU).
Pluto's astronomical symbol (â™‡, Unicode U+2647, â™‡) was then created as a monogram constructed from the letters "PL".
