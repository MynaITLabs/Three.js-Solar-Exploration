| Bou-yu | **See the whole**</br>Each member works on respective parts.</br>Keep work on schedule for timely delivery.</br></br>**Communication**</br>Met with the whole group to see what needs to be done and what people are interested in doing.</br>Talked with team member about data format and how to make it easier to import.</br></br>**Decide as late as possible**</br>Every team member works on a prototype of the different functionalities and we will be able to decide on functionalities best suite our need.</br>|
| Chenhua| **See the whole**</br>Discussed on the project landscape, direction, standards and rules.</br>Divided the project to different work parts: data collection, front end UI, front end Three.js and back end (Spring boot + MySQL)</br></br>**Decide as late as possible**</br>Try to get all possible solutions then decide which one is better.</br></br>**Communication**</br>Keep communicating with team members for design ideas and Three.js learning experience. </br></br>
| Yuntian| **See the whole**</br>We know we have three part: front end, back end, and database. So we let each one be responsible for at least one part, and go to learn some technique.</br></br>**Communication**</br>This week, I participate in the meeting and communicate with the team member about the design and technique use of our project, it show the communication value in XP.</br></br>**Decide as late as possible**</br>As we are not familiar with the Three.js, we decide to write the prototype first, and then decide what we will do next, this show the decide as late as possible.</br>|
| Bo| **Communication**</br>For better communication, we setup a Wechat group for daily discussion. The goal is to keep everyone updated on each others progress and solve technical or non-techincal issue ASAP through communication.</br></br>**Decide as late as possible**</br>Because most of the team members are not familiar with THREE.js, so we decided to make prototypes first, instead of making the final decision about what the UI will look like exactly.</br>|
